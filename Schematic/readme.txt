The difference between DE1-SoC Rev C and Rev D:

Both 5V and GPIO 3.3V power  are provided by two different power module LTM4624 respectively in Rev C. 
In Rev D, 5V power is provided by one LTC3605 regulator instead of LTC4624, GPIO 3.3V power is provided 
by one original on-board LTC3605 regulator which provides all 3.3V power for DE1-SoC board.
